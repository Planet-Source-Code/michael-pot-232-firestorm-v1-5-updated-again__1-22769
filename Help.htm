  V1.5 Help</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>This help-file explains what features are avaliable in firestorm and how to 
  use them.<br>

<p><br>
  This is what you see when you first open Firestorm:<br>
  <img src="Help/src1.jpg" width="424" height="482"> <br>
  Heres a quick run-down of the features:</p>
<p>1. This is the main viewing window, where all the action happens. Right now 
  no palette is chosen so nothing appears.</p>
<p>2. This is where you select the palette from, the program scans the Palettes 
  directory for palettes and adds them here. Palettes are stored as 1Kb PAL files. 
  These can be created with the Firestorm Palette Generator<br>
  avaliable from <a href="http://www.planetsourcecode.com">Planet Source Code</a></p>
<p>3. This is the main Particle control window:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Deviation</b>: lateral movement of the particles<br>
    <b>Force</b>: positive or negative force of each particle<br>
    <b>Density</b>: number of particles (0 - 10000)<br>
    <b>Base Width</b>: width of the base from which the particles eminate<br>
    <b>Length</b>: flame length<br>
    <b>Gravity</b>: Amount of gravity applied to each particle, positive or negative<br>
    <b>X, Y</b>: position of emitter base<br>
    <b>Blur iterations</b>: number of times the program blurs the image each frame 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. This is a collection of pre-set fire displays. When you make a display youself, 
  hit the Add Preset button to immortalise it.</p>
<p>5. <b>Bitmapped Origin</b>: With this tool you can load a 200x200 8bit bitmap 
  into the program. If any areas of the bitmap have colours of palette index 250 
  or above they will become particle emitters. You can draw emitters with the 
  mouse (only when Bitmapped Origin is checked) aswell. Press 'Clear Origin' to 
  clear all emitters and 'Load Origin' to load a bitmap file.</p>
<p>6. With this feature you can save the fire animation as a series of bitmaps 
  in a pre-defined directory.</p>
<p>7. <b>General Information</b>: The current Frames Per Second (FPS) and Bits 
  per pixel of the bitmap (always 8)</p>
<p>8. This is the general toolbar. The 4 buttons from left to right are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Pause</b>: During many external operations Firestorm pauses its engine 
    as not to burden the other process, If the image is frozen and you dont know 
    why, check that the pause button is Not inset or click on the Control <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-&gt;</font> 
    Pause menu option.</p>
  <p><b>About</b>: Displays the about box</p>
  <p><b>Help</b>: What you're reading now.</p>
  <p><b>Fullscreen: </b>changes the screen resolution to 320x200 and brings up 
    a unobstructed view of the fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using Firestorm</font></h2>
<p>First select a palette so you can see what's going on...<br>
  Fire is the most realistic palette while SeaBlue is more otherworldly<br>
  and Infrared is like looking through Infra-Red goggles.</p>
<p>Then play around with the particle controls until you're happy...<br>
  this may take awhile and dont forget to look at some of the<br>
  presets...</p>
<p>Turn on Bitmapped-Origin for more specilised flames, clear the origin then 
  click and<br>
  drag the mouse around in the main view to draw with fire. If the fire thins 
  out while drawing,<br>
  increase the Particle Density.</p>
<p>When you're happy, click the Save button to render the fire as a series of 
  bitmaps.<br>
  In the Save Fire dialog box, you can select how many frames to render and where 
  to place<br>
  the bitmaps. There is also an option to restart the fire particles before saving...</p>

<p>Happy Pyromania!</p>
